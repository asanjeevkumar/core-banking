      # Set up Kubernetes credentials
      # This step is crucial and depends heavily on your Kubernetes cluster provider and configuration.
      # You might need to:
      # - Install kubectl (often pre-installed on runners)
      # - Configure kubeconfig using secrets
      # - Authenticate with your cloud provider to get cluster access

          # Example: Login to cloud provider and get cluster credentials

      # Optional: Update image tags in Kubernetes manifests
      # This step replaces the :latest tag with the specific image tag from the CI build.
      # You'll need to get the image tag from the workflow_run event or a tag push.
      # The example below is conceptual and needs to be adapted based on how you get the image tag.
      # Consider using tools like `kustomize` or `helm` for managing Kubernetes manifests.
